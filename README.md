# Sweater-App
Do you need a sweater?

This application uses jQuery, Node, Express, Forecast API and Google Maps API. 

The client chooses a city from the view, that city is loaded into the Google Maps API function to convert the city into coordinates. 

The coordinates are passed to the server and Forecast API is queried and returns the current weather to the view.

jQuery updates the view with the current weather and forecast summary for the selected city.
